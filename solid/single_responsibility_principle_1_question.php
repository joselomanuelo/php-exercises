/*
EXERCISE (Single Responsibility Principle - SRP):

Right now, the class Invoice is doing THREE different things:
1. It manages invoice items and calculates the total.
2. It formats the invoice as text.
3. It saves the invoice to a file.

‚ö†Ô∏è This violates SRP because a class should have ONLY ONE reason to change.

üëâ Your task:
- Refactor the code into SEPARATE classes.
- One class should handle the invoice data and total calculation.
- One class should handle formatting/printing.
- One class should handle saving to a file.

After refactoring, each class must have ONLY ONE responsibility.
